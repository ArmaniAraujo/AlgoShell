### Problem 1: Is Palindrome
Write a function that takes in a string and
returns True if the string is a palindrome
otherwise False.

A palindrome is a string that is written the same
way forward as backwards. Note that single-character
strings are palindromes.

**Sample Input:**
```python
string = 'abcdcba'
```
**Sample Output:**
```python
True
```
**Please follow these steps:**
1. Write your solution in `solutions/is_palindrome.py`
2. Test your solution with `./AlgoShell.sh IsPalindrome`
